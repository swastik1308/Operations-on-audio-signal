# Operations-on-audio-signal
Spectrum Internship/ Task-2 of MATLAB
Write a program in MATLAB that will modulate and de-modulate a signal and plot it accordingly.
Follow the steps 
1.	First ask the user to start the recording, and save that recording in a file.*audio must be of 10 sec.
2.	Then use that file and a carrier signal to modulate .*take the Carrier signal as per your wish.
3.	After modulating it de-modulate the modulated signal to get the same input signal .
4.	Plot 4 signal :-   I.  Input signal(your voice)
II. Carrier signal
III. Modulated signal
VI. De-modulated signal
5.	And after a pause of 5 sec play the demodulated signal in the background.
